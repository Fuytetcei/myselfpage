  The target of this project is build a simple web site about my self (curriculum,
  contact data, etc).

  1.- HTML TAGS SUMMARY:

  html is a markup languaje that sets the structure of a web site. The html files
  have ".html" file extension and it's recognised by the browser to start loading
  the web page. The web browsers are just some kind of "html readers".
  The "index.html" file is the first file that all browser needs
  in order to start the web page loading.

  The content use to be between HTML tags (open and close).
  Heading tags define the hierarchy of the content. The less the number
  more important content. In general:
  <h1> contains the page title or organization name
  <h2> contains the main subjet (idea) of the page
  <h3> to <h6> are for the diviosion of the content of the page

  <p> (paragraph tag) section adds a paragraph content in between header sentions.

  <ul>/<li> (unordered list tags) section lists unordered text.
  <ol> same as "ul" but ordered. It numer all the elements.

  html tags don't have to always contain text, they can contain another
  tags or content.

  All visible content must be in between a <body> tag. It is not displays
  anything special but it helps to organize the code.

  head tag is used to add another functions to the page, will see in future.

  <!DOCTYPE html> sets the html version. If you don't specify anyone the
  browser will take the decision.
